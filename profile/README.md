## Hi there 👋

NovelService allows you to download any number of websites as a single ebook.

I, [XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin), will place the focus of the project not on the functionality, but on the technical site of developing an distributed cloud application. I want it to serve as an example for others on what an potential architecture of an distributed cloud application could look like. I'm mainly a backend developer, so that part of this application will always be better than the frontend.  
See [here](https://github.com/NovelService/.github#architecture) for an architecture overview.

It currently is still in it's very early stages, but you can check the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/NovelService/projects/2) to see what I am planning to do next.
